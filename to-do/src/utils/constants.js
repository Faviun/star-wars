export const textCaminoInfo = `Kamino, called Big Stormy by some clone troopers, also known as the Planet of Storms, was an aquatic planet located in a remote star system in the far reaches of Wild Space, and due to this, it was widely considered extra-galactic due to being peripheral to the galaxy. It was inhabited by a race of tall, elegant beings called the Kaminoans and the capital world of the Ruling Council, headed by the Prime Minister. Kaminoans kept to themselves and were known for their cloning technology, and for the creation of a clone army for the Galactic Republic`;

export const cloneBoss = `RC-1138, who goes by the name "Boss", is the player character throughout Republic Commando. A clone commando, he was trained by the Mandalorian Walon Vau and placed in charge of Delta Squad. First seeing action on Geonosis at the start of the Clone Wars, he participated in several covert missions for the Republic, including the investigation (and defense) of a seemingly abandoned assault ship, the Prosecutor, and the liberation of the Wookiee leader Tarfful. Through these missions, he strives against the armies of the CIS, not just droids but also Geonosian soldiers and Trandoshan mercenaries. He also receives side-missions en route to his main objectives, including the destruction of weapon emplacements, enemy ships and bunkers. His commando armor has distinctive orange markings on the helmet and across the chest and right shoulder.`;

export const cloneScorch = `RC-1262, also known as "Scorch", is a clone commando also trained by Walon Vau. Delta Squad's munitions expert, he was the first Boss rejoins with on their deployment on Geonosis. Often making witty comments, he has an inflated sense of irony which some mistook as fatalism. He often verbally spars with fellow squad member Sev. Scorch's unique armor has yellow patches on the wrists and legs.`;

export const cloneFixer = `RC-1140 is a clone commando who prefers to do things by the book, even calling his squad members by their numerical designation. Given the nickname "Fixer", he often takes it on himself to chastise clone brothers Scorch and Sev when they start to banter. Proficient in computer slicing, he is often quiet, usually speaking only when he is asked for his opinion. His armor has green stripes and markings, making it very distinctive.`;

export const cloneSev = `RC-1207, known to others as "Sev", he is a fierce warrior and expert sniper. Having a grim sense of humor, he often bantered with Scorch. Painting his armor blood red, it often caused confusion as to whether paint was used or actual blood. The wrists and lower legs were red, and a red hand print covered the front of his helmet.`;
